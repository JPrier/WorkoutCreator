### What It Does

This python script creates a csv of workouts. It creates the workouts through a CSP (Constraint Satisfaction Problem) algorithm, which takes constants set in [exercise.py](https://github.com/JPrier/WorkoutCreator/blob/main/exercises.py) and selects exercises into circuit or super sets. The exercises are constrained on which muscle group the other exercises are from in the same set or workout, and the number of times the muscle group or exercise has been worked in a cycle/split. 


### WHY

I have seen/read studies about building muscle through resistance training that have shown that changing the split and order of workouts can help increase the speed of muscle growth. For changing the order the idea is that you are less tired at the beginning of a workout so changing what starts means different muscle groups get a chance to work at full strength.

This project is mainly for myself, I like to frequently change up my split style to keep working-out interesting.
