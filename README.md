### What It Does

This python script creates a csv of workouts. It creates the workouts through constants/config set in the exercises.py file. 

A split is a list of workouts, a workout is a list of muscle groups, and a muscle group is a list of exercises. Each muscle group has a list of other muscle groups that can be supersetted with it. Each workout contains a certain number of sets that contain a certain number of exercises that are all set in exercises.py.


### WHY

Most studies that I have seen/read about building muscle through resistance training has shown that changing the split and order of workouts can help increase the speed of muscle growth. For changing the order the idea is that you are less tired at the beginning of a workout so changing what starts means different muscle groups get a chance to work at full strength.

This project is mainly for myself, I like to frequently change up my split style to keep working out interesting.
